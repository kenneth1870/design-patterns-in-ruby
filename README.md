# Design Patterns in Ruby

## Design Patterns

### GoF Patterns
* **Adapter**: helps two incompatible interfaces to work together
* **Builder**: create complex objects that are hard to configure
* **Command**: performs some specific task without having any information about the receiver of the request
* **Composite**: builds a hierarchy of tree objects and interacts with all them the same way
* **Decorator**: vary the responsibilities of an object adding some features
* **Factory**: create objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created
* **Interpreter**: provides a specialized language to solve a well defined problem of know domain
* **Iterator**: provides a way to access a collection of sub-objects without exposing the underlaying representation
* **Observer**: helps building a highly integrated system, maintainable and avoids coupling between classes
* **Proxy**: allows us having more control over how and when we access to a certain object
* **Singleton**: have a single instance of certain class across the application
* **Strategy**: varies part of an algorithm at runtime
* **Template**: redefines certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure

### Object-oriented design concepts
* [Abstract classes ](https://github.com/kenneth1870/design-patterns-in-ruby/blob/master/abstract.rb)

* [Inheritance](https://github.com/kenneth1870/design-patterns-in-ruby/blob/master/inheritance.rb)
* [Interfaces](https://github.com/kenneth1870/design-patterns-in-ruby/blob/master/interface.rb)

* [Polymorphism](https://github.com/kenneth1870/design-patterns-in-ruby/blob/master/polymorphism.rb) 


### Patterns For Ruby

* [Convention Over Configuration](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/#convention-over-configuration): build an extensible system and not carrying the configuration burden.
* [Domain-Specific Language](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/writing-a-domain-specific-language-in-ruby): build a convenient syntax for solving problems of a specific domain.
* [Meta-Programming](https://www.toptal.com/ruby/ruby-metaprogramming-cooler-than-it-sounds): gain more flexibility when defining new classes and create custom tailored objects on the fly.
